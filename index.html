<p>Microbuilder is a toolkit that helps you build system across micro-services implemented in various languages communicating via RESTful JSON API.</p>

<p>We, some guys in ThoughtWorks, are working for a client helping them maintain a large legacy system.</p>

<p>The legacy system were one single J2EE application that contains hundreds of thousands of lines of source code. The application was tightly coupled and very hard to add new feature.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years, we turned the system into Microservice Architecture. We experienced a huge improvement in productivity and maintainability during the process. Nowaday, there are hundreds of microservices in the system, and we are continuously creating new microservices for new business domains.</p>

<p>These microservices are written in different programming languages like Scala, Ruby, Java, or JavaScript, and usually are maintained by different teams spread on different countries.</p>

<p>As a result, the communication between people became one of the most serious topics in our system, and Microbuilder is designed for communication.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-microbuilder-works" class="anchor" href="#how-microbuilder-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Microbuilder works</h3>

<p>We designed a language to define RESTful JSON API, named MIDL (Microbuilder Interface Definition Language).</p>

<p>You can define data structures and endpoints in object-oriented syntax, with a little annotations like @:route.</p>

<p>@:final class UserProfile {
  public function new() {}
  public var name:String;
  public var email:String;
  public var address:String;
}</p>

<p>interface IUserService {
  @:route("GET", "users/{id}")
  function getUser(id:String):UserProfile;
}
Developers could perform following tasks around MIDL when building microservices:</p>

<p>service developers use MIDL to define their specific domain API.
service developers generate API Documentation from MIDL.
service developers generate server-side stubs from MIDL for target languages (including Scala, JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, C++, ActionScript 3, NekoVM, and Python), then implement the RESTful service with the help of the stubs.
service developers generate client-side SDK from MIDL for target languages, and publish the SDK.
service users use the client-side SDK in an application, in order to call the service in a RPC flavor.
Note that every task listed above is optional. For example, you may want to create MIDL to fit the current API of a legacy service, and generate client-side SDK and documentation for it, so that other applications will be easy to communicate with the legacy service. However, you will not generate server-side stubs because you already have a service implementation before.</p>
